How to install
==============

Before we begin...
 1) This release (v2.1) has been tested on weewx version 3.0.1, on Ubuntu linux 14.04 and on a Raspberry Pi running
    wheezy.
    Versions of Weewx before v3 will not work. The earlier release v2.01 is on github and works with Weewx 2.4 - 2.7.
 2) This has been tested on sqlite databases. Mysql may work however this has not been tested.


The easy way
============

Get hold of the v2.1 archive from github:   https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/archive/v2.1.tar.gz

Use the WeeWx extension installer:

   cd /home/weewx
   setup.py --extension --install [wherever you've put v2.1.tar.gz]

Web content is stored in public_html/Bootstrap.

Enjoy.


The involved way
================

Step 1 - Download from github:
------------------------------

To get the latest development code:
   git clone git://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer

To get the latest stable(ish) release, point your browser here:
   https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/releases

Move gaugeengine.py, gauges.py and historyengine,py into the bin/user directory.
Move the Bootstrap and Images directory into the skins directory.


Step 2 - Add the skins to weewx.conf
------------------------------------

So the [StdReport] section will need to look something like this:

    [StdReport]
        # This section specifies what reports, using which skins, to generate.

        # Where the skins reside, relative to WEEWX_ROOT:
        SKIN_ROOT = skins

        # Where the generated reports should go, relative to WEEWX_ROOT:
        HTML_ROOT = public_html

        [[SmallImages]]
            # These are the images used on the front page of the website.
            # Dimensions are set in the Images/skin.conf file
            #
            skin = Images
            HTML_ROOT = public_html/Bootstrap

        [[BigImages]]
            # These images are used when a small web page image is clicked on.
            # So the skin.conf image_width and image_height are overridden here.
            #
            skin = Images
            HTML_ROOT = public_html/Bootstrap/big_images/
            [[[ImageGenerator]]]
                image_width = 800
                image_height = 500

        [[HTMLPages]]
            # This generates the webpages themselves.
            #
            skin = Bootstrap
            HTML_ROOT = public_html/Bootstrap

        [[FTP]]
            skin = Ftp

        [[RSYNC]]
            skin = Rsync


Step 3 - Add Bootstrap support files to your website
----------------------------------------------------

Add this file to weewx/public_html/js:
    bootstrap.min.js

and this one to weewx/public_html/css:
    css/bootstrap.min.css

You can use the wget command to download these:
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/v2.1/public_html/Bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/v2.1/public_html/Bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js


Step 4 - (Optional) Translate skins to Spanish Language
-------------------------------------------------------
For skins in Spanish please use v2.01. They are in the process of being ported over to v2.1.

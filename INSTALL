How to install
==============

Before we begin...
 1) This release (v2.2) has been tested on Weewx version 3.0.1, on Ubuntu linux 14.04 and on a Raspberry Pi running
    wheezy.
    Versions of Weewx before v3 will not work. The earlier release v2.01 is on github and works with Weewx 2.4 - 2.7.
 2) This has been tested on sqlite databases. Mysql and any other Weewx supported databases should work too.


The easy way
============

Get hold of the release archive from github:   https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/releases

Use the Weewx extension installer:

   cd /home/weewx
   setup.py --extension --install [wherever you've put the .tar.gz archive]

Web content is stored in public_html/Bootstrap.

Enjoy.


The involved way
================

Step 1 - Download from github:
------------------------------

To get the latest development code:
   git clone git://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer

To get the latest stable(ish) release, point your browser here:
   https://github.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/releases

Move gaugeengine.py, gauges.py, historyengine,py and translateengine.py into the bin/user directory.
Move the Bootstrap and Images directory into the skins directory.
Move any language specific files you want into skins/languages.


Step 2 - Add the skins to weewx.conf
------------------------------------

So the [StdReport] section will need to look something like this:

    [StdReport]
        # This section specifies what reports, using which skins, to generate.

        # Where the skins reside, relative to WEEWX_ROOT:
        SKIN_ROOT = skins

        # Where the generated reports should go, relative to WEEWX_ROOT:
        HTML_ROOT = public_html

        [[SmallImages]]
            # These are the images used on the front page of the website.
            # Dimensions are set in the Images/skin.conf file
            #
            skin = Images
            HTML_ROOT = public_html/Bootstrap

        [[BigImages]]
            # These images are used when a small web page image is clicked on.
            # So the skin.conf image_width and image_height are overridden here.
            #
            skin = Images
            HTML_ROOT = public_html/Bootstrap/big_images/
            [[[ImageGenerator]]]
                image_width = 800
                image_height = 500

        [[HTMLPages]]
            # This generates the webpages themselves.
            #
            skin = Bootstrap
            HTML_ROOT = public_html/Bootstrap

        [[FTP]]
            skin = Ftp

        [[RSYNC]]
            skin = Rsync


Step 3 - Add Bootstrap support files to your website
----------------------------------------------------

Add these files to weewx/public_html/js:
    bootstrap.min.js
    ekko-lightbox.min.js

and this one to weewx/public_html/css:
    css/bootstrap.min.css

You can use the wget command to download these:
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/v2.2/public_html/Bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/v2.2/public_html/Bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brewster76/fuzzy-archer/v2.2/public_html/Bootstrap/js/ekko-lightbox.min.js

Step 4 - (Optional) Display skins in Spanish or French Language
---------------------------------------------------------------
Just choose your language using the "language" setting in the [Languages] section of skin.conf.

Remember to make changes to both skins/Bootstrap/skin.conf (for the html text) and skins/Images/skin.conf (for
the graphs).
